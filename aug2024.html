            <p> In August 2024 I decided I wanted to learn how to do my own nails, I'd been playing with the idea for
                months but hadn't actually committed - until now. I started watching videos and reading how-to guides,
                learning safety, and gathering my supplies. </p>

            <p>One of my first ever Gel-X sets. These weren't bad at all considering I was an absolute beginner but
                unfortunately I did know a thing about retention and they only lasted maybe a day.</p>

            <p>I was a month into my journey and had finally gotten chrome powders... didn't know much about what I was
                doing but loved the chrome look.
